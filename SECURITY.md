### Transaction Hashes (Public)
- ✅ All deployment and configuration transaction hashes

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Enhanced .gitignore
Added comprehensive patterns to prevent accidentally committing sensitive files:
```
# Sensitive files - NEVER COMMIT THESE
.env
.env.*
*account*.json
*keystore*.json
*private*
*secret*
*.key
*.pem
*mnemonic*
*seed*
```

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration
- All private keys must be set through environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in any configuration files
- Example usage in scripts: `$STARKNET_PRIVATE_KEY`

### 3. Secure Deployment Scripts
- Updated `deployment.sh` to check for environment variables
- Removed all hardcoded private keys
- Added validation for required environment variables

## 🚨 Critical Security Notes

### ⚠️ NEVER COMMIT:
- Private keys
- Seed phrases
- Account keystore files
- `.env` files with secrets
- Any file containing `0x` followed by 64 hex characters (private keys)

### ✅ SAFE TO COMMIT:
- Contract addresses (public blockchain data)
- Transaction hashes (public blockchain data)
- Public keys (designed to be public)
- Class hashes (public blockchain data)
- Account addresses (public blockchain data)

## 🔄 Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Always use environment variables** for sensitive data
2. **Double-check .gitignore** before committing
3. **Review files with `git diff`** before pushing
4. **Use `git-secrets`** to scan for sensitive data
5. **Rotate keys** if accidentally exposed
